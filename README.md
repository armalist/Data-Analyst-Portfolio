# Ariqah Maulia Listiani - Data-Analyst-Portfolio

Hi, I'm Ariqah! I graduated in Physics from Institut Teknologi Bandung and discovered my passion for data analysis and machine learning through both academic and professional experiences. I have built a strong foundation in analytics, problem-solving, and turning data into meaningful insights.

I completed the Bangkit Academy Machine Learning Path, where I worked on an industry-based capstone project and was recognized as one of the best presenters. I also gained international exposure through the Startup Ecosystem Exposure (ITB–Untar–UI–NUS), which deepened my understanding of innovation, product-market fit, and startup growth strategies.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
