# Ariqah Maulia Listiani - Data-Analyst-Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Ariqah! I graduated in Physics from Institut Teknologi Bandung and discovered my passion for data analysis and machine learning through both academic and professional experiences. I have built a strong foundation in analytics, problem-solving, and turning data into meaningful insights.

I completed the Bangkit Academy Machine Learning Path, where I worked on an industry-based capstone project and was recognized as one of the best presenters. I also gained international exposure through the Startup Ecosystem Exposure (ITB–Untar–UI–NUS), which deepened my understanding of innovation, product-market fit, and startup growth strategies.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### E-Commerce Public - Project Data Analysis
**Code:** [`notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/armalist/E-Commerce-Public-Project/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze a public e-commerce dataset and answer three key business questions:
  - What is the trend in the number of monthly orders in the past year across different geographic regions?
  - How is the relationship between delivery time and customer satisfaction in order reviews?
  - Which product category has the highest sales in the last six months?

**Description:** This project utilized the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset, which consists of nine different datasets covering customers, orders, reviews, products, payments, sellers, and geolocation. The analysis workflow included:
  - Data Wrangling: gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data (handling missing values, duplicates, and invalid records).
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics and exploration of each dataset.
  - Explanatory Analysis: answering the business questions through data merging, grouping, and visualization.

**Skills:** 
  - Data Wrangling: detecting and handling missing values (median imputation, default filling, etc.), removing duplicate records, identifying and correcting invalid values. (e.g., geolocation issues).
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics for multiple datasets, grouping and aggregating data, analyzing relationships between variables.
  - Business Data Analysis: monthly order trends by region, relationship between delivery time and review scores, identifying best-selling product categories.
  - Data Visualization: building clear visualizations for trends, distributions, and comparisons.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, textblob, datetime.

**Results:** 
  - Monthly Order Trends
    - Monthly orders showed fluctuations with clear peaks (e.g., during holiday or online shopping events).
    - Regional differences (customer_state) highlighted potential market opportunities.
  - Delivery Time vs. Customer Satisfaction
    - Faster delivery times correlated with higher review scores.
    - Delays in delivery negatively impacted customer satisfaction.
  - Top Product Categories (Last 6 Months)
    - Categories such as beleza_saude, cama_mesa_banho, utilidades_domesticas, relogios_presentes, and moveis_decoracao ranked highest in sales.
    - These insights provide valuable input for inventory management, promotions, and market segmentation strategies.
